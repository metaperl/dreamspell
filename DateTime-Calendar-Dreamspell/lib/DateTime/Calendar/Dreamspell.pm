=for understanding year determination

Similar to how a school year spans calendar years, a Dreamspell year does the same thing.

We will define each Dreamspell year by the calendar year it begins with. 

Since "Yellow Self-Existing Seed Year" spans 2009-07-26 to 2010-07-25, a Gregorian date
with year 2009 would belong to that Dreamspell year if its month/day is 7/26 to 12/31.
Otherwise, it would belong to Dreamspell year 2008.

  (

   2008 => 'blue electric storm',
   2009 => 'yellow self-existing seed'

  );
